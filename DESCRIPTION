Package: spcv
Title: a minimalist package for anticipating prediction errors in spatial interpolation through cross validation
Version: 0.0.0.9000

Description: spcv considers potential errors arising from 
  the non-parametric inverse distance weighting method of interpolation.
  The package is for personal consumption, aimed at furthering my
  understanding of the environmental datasets I work with.
  More efficient implimentations of cross validation than can  
  be found elsewhere, including in gstat.
Depends: R (>= 3.4.3)
